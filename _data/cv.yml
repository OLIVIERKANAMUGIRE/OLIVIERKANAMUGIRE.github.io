    - title: Longitudinal Multimodal Learning with Imaging-Based Priors for Personalized Disease Progression Modeling
      year: Current
      description: Precision medicine requires models that move beyond population-level predictions toward individualized disease
        understanding and treatment planning. While medical imaging captures rich structural and functional disease information at the
        population scale, it is rarely leveraged as an explicit prior for personalized longitudinal modeling. At the same time, patient-specific
        modalities such as clinical measurements, demographics, and lifestyle factors provide crucial contextual signals but are often sparse and noisy.
        The aim is to model personalized disease progression by treating population-level imaging features as priors and updating them into individual
        posteriors using longitudinal clinical and contextual data.
