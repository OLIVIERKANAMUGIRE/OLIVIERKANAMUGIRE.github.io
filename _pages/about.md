I am a mathematician with strong interests in applied mathematics, optimization, and the mathematical foundations of machine learning. I am currently affiliated with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS-Rwanda), where I have been developing a solid background in rigorous mathematical analysis, probability, and computational methods through teaching assistantship.

My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and real-world applications, particularly in optimization, partial differential equations, statistical learning, and data-driven modeling. I am especially motivated by problems where deep mathematical theory informs practical algorithms, such as in machine learning, computer vision, and scientific computing.

Through my academic training, I have gained experience in advanced mathematics, numerical methods, and programming for scientific applications. I enjoy working on problems that require both theoretical insight and computational implementation, and I am keen to further strengthen this dual perspective during my doctoral studies.

This website collects information about my academic background, research interests, and ongoing projects.
